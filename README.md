# Quantile Regression DQN and C51 DQN

In pong, qr-dqn will be convergence in 5000000 time-steps with 16 actors. About 2 times faster than c51.

I use MSE for qr-dqn.
The offline training one is almost like rainbow.

Segment tree and replay memory are modified version and the original code is from tusimple

### To do
I'm trying to use quantile huber loss in the future.
